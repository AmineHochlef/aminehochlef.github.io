<p>In the past year or so, I have become very interested in machine learning and its applications. This led me to self-learn it alongside my bachelor’s degree in computer science. I had heard about “learning in public” and sharing what you learn with others before I began this journey, but I thought to myself, “This seems like a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>Fast forward seven months, and I regret not creating a blog and posting things online.</p>
<section id="what-this-blog-will-contain" class="level1">
<h1>What This Blog Will Contain</h1>
<p>Since this is a technical blog, I won’t be writing about my activities outside of my professional career. The blog will contain posts about machine learning, things I’ve learned, fun projects I’ve worked on, tools I find interesting, and quirky observations about our cool planet—you get the idea.</p>
<p>My goal is to write posts about anything interesting I come across, reflections after a talk or conference, and maybe more.</p>
</section>
<section id="thoughts" class="level1">
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>As a beginner writer who’s just starting to take steps into learning in public, I will prioritize this effort by committing to writing at least one post per month.</p>
<p>Let the fun begin!</p>
