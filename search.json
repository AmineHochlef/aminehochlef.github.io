    "text": "In the past year or so, I have become very interested in machine learning and its applications. This led me to self-learn it alongside my bachelor’s degree in computer science. I had heard about “learning in public” and sharing what you learn with others before I began this journey, but I thought to myself, “This seems like a lot of trouble.”\nFast forward seven months, and I regret not creating a blog and posting things online.\n\nWhat This Blog Will Contain\nSince this is a technical blog, I won’t be writing about my activities outside of my professional career. The blog will contain posts about machine learning, things I’ve learned, fun projects I’ve worked on, tools I find interesting, and quirky observations about our cool planet—you get the idea.\nMy goal is to write posts about anything interesting I come across, reflections after a talk or conference, and maybe more.\n\n\nThoughts\nAs a beginner writer who’s just starting to take steps into learning in public, I will prioritize this effort by committing to writing at least one post per month.\nLet the fun begin!"
